Work done so far
----------------
1. Moved code from github to google code under "trenchguinea" branch
2. Integration tests used to contain a copy of the scalatestexamples from ScalaTest 1.0-snapshot, which didn't compile anymore,
   so I changed them to auto-export from SCM in the generate-test-sources phase into the target/generated/src/test folder.
   a. I placed into target so that a clean would be sure to copy down a clean set of the examples
   b. The way the tests were executed from the Runner wasn't entirely valid to make them pass so fixed them
3. Did other prep for release like release notes, JavaDoc and Source XRef reports, and the Cobertura code-coverage report


To Use
------
1. Disable maven-surefire-plugin by setting skipTests=true
2. Add maven-scalatest-plugin to <build> section and configure the "test" goal in an execution
3. Execute "test" phase or directly execute the scalatest:test or scalatest:gui goals


Future implementation thoughts
------------------------------
1. Could actually integrate with Surefire directly by implementing SurefireProvider API
   a. The current method of disabling surefire to replace with scalatest is a bit of a hack and drops features that surefire would expect
   b. May allow the surefire-report-plugin "just work", though not sure about this
   c. This would require a lot of the discovery logic currently in Runner to be externally-consumable so that Surefire can discover the tests
2. To really be a replacement for surefire we'd need a replacement for the surefire-report-plugin. Users commonly use the surefire output
   for verifying process compliance.
   a. We could write a report goal that just dumps the text to a file and links that file into the site but it's far from ideal
   b. Once the HTML/Flex reporter is available that the report goal executes that reporter (at least by default)
